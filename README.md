# Electronic-Piano
 Design and build a digital piano using an Arduino MCU

## Overview

Designed and implemented a digital piano system using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, push-button inputs, and a buzzer output module. The project focused on basic circuit interfacing, digital input processing, and audio signal generation using embedded systems programming.

The piano consists of seven input keys corresponding to musical notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, and B). When a key is pressed, the Arduino generates a square-wave signal at the corresponding frequency to produce the musical tone through the buzzer.

## Source Code

Use Timer0 and Timer2 to generate the PWM signals. Connect OC0A and OC0B (PD6 and
PD5) to IN1 and IN2. These two output signals control a DC motor. 
Connect OC2A and OC2B (PB3 and PD3) to IN3 and IN4.These two output signals
control the other DC motor.
